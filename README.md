Herpesviruses mimic zygotic genome activation to promote viral replication

This repository includes workflows and scripts used for the paper: Herpesviruses mimic zygotic genome activation to promote viral replication.

Accompanying sequencing data is available in the paper.

The analysis can be reran by recreating the specific environments and genome references. To do this make sure that conda is installed. Additionaly, mamba is required as well (in your base environment).
